                                Have you been in a situation where you are in trouble and fear is creeping in? I have. What started as an exhilarating day of backcountry skiing at Revelstoke Mountain turned into a nightmarish waiting game in the cold and pain after breaking my leg. 
                                <br/>
                                However, performing the Wim Hof breathing method while being rescued helped me stay calm for up to 4 hours under difficult circumstances. From this experience, I would like to share the breathing method and my custom app to enhance your breathing skills that can do so much for you.

                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">The Wim Hof Breathing Method is deceptively simple, yet profoundly effective. It is a form of controlled hyperventilation that saturates your blood with oxygen while reducing carbon dioxide levels. This creates a temporary alkaline environment in the body, which triggers numerous physiological responses, including:</p>

                    <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4 text-lg">
                        <li>Get comfortable - Lie down or sit comfortably and make sure your belly can expand freely.</li>
                        <li>Take in a deep inhalation - Inhale deeply while pushing your belly outward.</li>
                        <li>Let out a relaxed exhalation - Release through the mouth without force.</li>
                        <li>Repeat the deep breaths - Take 20-40 breaths depending on your skill level.</li>
                        <li>Retention phase - After your last exhale, hold your breath for as long as you can comfortably manage.</li>
                        <li>Recovery phase - When your body signals the need for air, inhale fully and hold for 15 seconds before releasing. This completes one round.</li>
                        <li>Repeat 3-5 sets of the entire process.</li>
                    </ol>
